# How to book Webcast or simply Recording for an event in Indico.

The CERN Webcast Service opens CERN lectures, meetings and seminars to universities, schools and to the general public. This service allows you to watch live events from equipped rooms on http://webcast.cern.ch and provides video recording of these events for future viewing.

This short video guides you through Webcast/Recording booking via Indico.

Go to your Indico event management page.  

Make sure that the event takes place in a room that is **equipped** with webcast and Recording!
To see which rooms these are, go to the Indico _Room booking_ page, and click on _Book a room_. Use the **filter banner** to display only rooms equipped for Webcast and Recording. You will see the list of candidate rooms.

Before selecting one of them, **make sure it is available** at the time of your event.

If your event is a **Lecture**, you can click on Webcast/recording and you will be able to send the request for a Webcast right away.
If your event is a **Conference** or a **Meeting**, on the other hand, you will need to create a contribution to your event first.

To do this, click on _Timetable_ on the left banner, under _Settings_. Click on _Add new_, and then on _Contribution_. Insert the title of your contribution and a brief description, and Indicate the start time and its duration. Add _Speakers_ to your contribution by searching for them, or by adding them manually. Once you are finished defining your contribution, click on Save. More details on this process can be found in the section "Make the timetable" of the "Meeting" chapter in this book.

You are now ready to request Webcast/Recording.

On the left banner of your event management page,  click on _Logistics_, under the _Services_ tab. Then click on _Webcast/Recording_. Hover over the question marks for explanations.

**Webcast** makes your event accessible live on the web via streaming, it does not leave any trace afterwards. The recording is made, but it is **not published** in the CERN Document Server (CDS).
if you decide, after the event, that you wish CDS publishing, you may request that from the "Webcast" support team [in the CERN Service Portal](https://cern.service-now.com/service-portal/report-ticket.do?name=general-help-rqf&fe=service-desk), during 1 year following the event.

If you click on _Webcast_ you will be asked to define restrictions, if any,for the community eligible to view the webcast. 

**Recording** allows your community to watch your event afterwards in   CDS. Speakers of your event, will be asked to electronically _sign_ their agreement to be recorded and to be made publicly available. 
Until **all** speakers sign the agreement, the recording cannot be published. 
Here, you will be able to send the e-agreement requests to all the speakers of your event.

You can decide whether you want to notify all the event managers of the speaker’s signature.

If you click on recording you will be asked to inform the experts’ team about additional restrictions, if any.

Uncheck _All contributions_ if you want the request for a Webcast and/or a recording to only apply to some of your contributions and not all of them, and select which ones.

Write some additional comments if you need to, and, once you've finished, click on _Send request_. 
You can click on _Webcast/recording_ if you want to modify or withdraw your request.

Your request will be pending approval. As event manager you will receive an email informing you about the status of your webcast/recording request. Once your request is accepted, you'll receive an email, containing a **link** redirecting you to your Webcast request page.

You must now prompt your speakers to agree with the recording and publishing of their talk.

Click on _Speaker Release Form_ in the Warning (yellow) box. Click on _Download_ if you want to print the agreement form in order for the speakers to sign in paper form. Else, if you want to let the speakers sign electronically, you can email the agreements to all the speakers (a list will be provided below).

Click on _Send_. You can customise the email message the speakers will receive, or leave the default text. Click on _Ok_. All the speakers will receive the request by email.

For each speaker to agree to the recording and its publishing, they will have to click on the link they'll receive by email informing them about the agreement that needs to be signed, by visiting the page and selecting _I agree_.

If the option to notify all event managers each time an agreement is signed has been selected, they will, all, receive the notification.
