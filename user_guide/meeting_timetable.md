## Making a Timetable

Click on the pencil at the top of your page to _switch to the management area_ of your event.

Then, click on _Timetable_ on your left, under _Settings_.

In this page, you will be able to add _Contributions_. 
Contributions can be grouped in different _Sessions_, and 
each Session can be divided in different _Session blocks_, 
for example a morning block and an afternoon block of your meeting.
You can add a Contribution either inside or outside a specific Session or Block.

### Adding a Session

Click on _Add new_, and then in _Session block_ to create a new _Session_.
Type in the name and description of your session and choose the duration, for example 1 hour. 
**Remember** that this will be the default duration for each contribution you will add.

Once you are finished, click on _Save_.

### Adding a Session block

Now, you will be asked to define your first _Block_.
Type in the title of your first block, in our case “morning”, and then the start time and duration, 1 hour, starting from 11am, for example.

Click on _Save_ to create your first block. This is your first **block** inside your first **session**.

Now we want to create another block, inside the same session.
To do this, click on _Add new_, and then _Session block_. 


We can create a new session altogether, or simply create a new block to our existing session. 

Click on your session under _Add another block to_, in order to create the new block. 

Select a title for your second block, such as “afternoon” and then choose its start time and duration, for example, 1 hour, starting from 2 pm.

Click on _Save_ to return to your timetable.

### Adding a Contribution

To add a _Contribution_ to a block for example, choose one of your blocks and click on it to make this window appear. 
On the window, click on _Go to session block timetable_.

Here, you can add a contribution, by simply clicking on _Add new_, and then on _Contribution_.

Type in the name and description of your contribution, as well as a start time. The duration will be the one you selected before.

Once you’re finished, click on _Save_. This will add a contribution in the given block.

You can also add a contribution outside your sessions and blocks, by simply clicking on _Add new_, then on _Contribution_, and repeat the process.
