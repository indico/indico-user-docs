       
Category Management
-------------------

You can re-allocate a sub-category or event by selecting the one you wish to move using the tick box and clicking on the horizontal arrows on your right,that show text *Move the selected category* when you point there with the mouse. You will then have to answer **where** you would like to reallocate this sub-category/event.

To delete a sub-category and anything it contains or an event, select it and click on the bin. Categories cannot be deleted if they are not empty.

### Protection

From the Management Area you can protect your category in terms of who can view it, who is its manager and who can create events in the category.

*Manager(s)* can be added to a category to allow access to the Management Area for modification. Category managers are either those listed in the category protection view or Indico administrators. The creator of a category will be able to modify it without being listed.

*Protection mode*: A category can be:
- *Public*: Anyone can view events in it, or
- *Inheriting*: The protection mode of the parent category (see breadcrumbs under the page top banner) applies, or
- *Protected*: Only those users in the *Access control list* or administrators can access the category. 

When a Category has 'Inheriting' or 'Protected' mode, the manager(s) can put a text of contact information to be shows to non-authorised viewers, so users with no access will know who to contact in order to request access. 

Important note for the 'Inheriting' protection mode: Changing the parent's protection will change the protection of its sub-categories.

*Event visibility*: This is **not** related to category *viewing* rights - those are regulated by the *Protection mode* explained above.  The choice offered, allows you to decide whether events in this category will be shown in *Today's events* and the *Calendar* from everywhere or from some parent categories only.


*Event creation settings*: You can restrict who is able to add events to the category. If you do so, you will need to add users or groups to the list in order to allow them to add events.
