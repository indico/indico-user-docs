### View your Bookings

You can view the bookings or pre-bookings that you made by going under the 'My bookings' sections of the Room Booking side menu:

This page contains all the information about all your bookings, and it allows you to modify, clone or cancel some of them, by clicking on the coloured zone of the booking done. If the room reservation is done for more than a single day, each of the occurences of the booking can be canceled individually. In addition, this page lets you watch the history of the booking \(e.g. the image below continues through a long list of reservations done for room 513-R-068 since 2013 and up to now.\)
