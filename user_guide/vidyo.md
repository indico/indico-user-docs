## Add existing Vidyo room

If you just need to _Add existing room_, start typing the name of the room. A list of existing rooms will be suggested, _Select_ the one you need and click on _Save_.

Going back to the _Event display view_ you will see that the room is now attached to your event.

You have the possibility to allow vidyo access to only **parts** of your event, by linking your vidyo room to specific contributions only.

## Create a new Vidyo romm

To _Create a new Vidyo room_, you'll see the name of your event appearing, by default, as the vidyo room name. You can change it to something more generic, to re-use in the future, if you want.

While defining the room parametres,use the _Description_ field to write something helpful for your users who will be joining in the future.

The default _Owner_ of the room is you, but you can _Choose_ someone else, who will be responsible, on the long term.

You can enter a _Moderation PIN_, if you want to moderate the room.
Anybody who knows the PIN will be able to perform the functions of a moderator. **Moderators** can Mute, Unmute, Hide Video, Show Video, and Remove a given participant or all participants from the conference.

You may also assign a _Room PIN_ , if you wish. It enables you to make your meeting 'private', only people to whom you give the PIN will be able to join your meeting.

If you want the participants who will join the room to be muted by default, make sure that the _Auto_ option is set to _ON_.

Click on _Save_.

Click on _Join_ and you will be directed to a Vidyo page.
Make sure you have Vidyo **installed** before doing this.
As a user, enter your name and click on _Connect_. A Vidyo window will appear.

In the Vidyo window, if you hover over the screen, you can see a banner with a few options. The most useful ones are:

- “Show participants” (useful for your event’s minutes). 
- “Group chats” (a very useful area to exchange web links and make comments about the Vidyo performance itself, for example if you can’t hear what’s being said). 
- “Screen share” (useful for interactive discussions and for navigating through slides).

In this banner you can also disable video and/or mute the audio.
It is a good idea to mute your microphone when you don’t speak to avoid background noise affecting the entire room.

Finally, you can click on the gear icon for some Vidyo configuration options, for example concerning your audio source.

You can choose to use the standard vidyo desktop app or the [CERN WebRTC](https://vidyowebrtc.web.cern.ch/) (Real Time Communication) client.
If you select the latter, the Vidyo Room URL will be already present. Just click on _Join the room_.
