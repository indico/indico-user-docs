# Events

## Introduction

Indico allows you to manage three basic types of event:

* [**Lectures**](lectures/about.md) can be seen as a single presentation, with one or more speakers;
* [**Meetings**](meetings/about.md) are generally composed of many presentations. They have a timetable and can last multiple days, although
they most commonly happen on a single day. Contributions (talks) can be organized in sessions;
* [**Conferences**](conferences/about.md) generally last multiple days and have the advantage over meetings of allowing multiple sessions to
happen in parallel. They also offer flexible abstract and paper reviewing/editing workflows.

All of these meeting types offer a set of common features, such as:

* Registration;
* Management of participants;
* Surveys;
* Integration with collaborative tools;
* Event reminders.
