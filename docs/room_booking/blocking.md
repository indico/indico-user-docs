# Blocking Rooms

## Block a room

!!! warning "Before you get started"
    If you wish to **keep a room from being booked** (*because e.g. the room is closed or under construction*), then
    you should use the **Non-bookable periods** option in the **Room Details** dialog (only available to room managers).

**Room Blockings** prevent regular users from booking certain rooms while allowing a restricted list of users to do so.
This feature can be used for special events which require a given room at 100% and need some kind of "room delegation"
mechanism. You can block any rooms you manage, but if you are not a manager, **you can still block rooms**.
However, those blockings have to be **approved** by the owners of those rooms.

To create such a blocking, go to **List of Rooms** in the Room Booking horizontal menu and follow these steps:

* Click **Actions** and then **Block Rooms**;
* Select the rooms you wish to block;
* Click the "checkmark" icon at the top right;
* Choose the period during which the rooms should be blocked by selecting the start/end date under **Period**;
* Enter a reason for the blocking - it will be displayed to users trying to book one of the blocked rooms;
* You may add additional rooms to the room list if needed;
* Unless you want to be the only one to be able to book the blocked rooms, you can add other users or groups to the
**Authorized users/groups** list;
* Click "Block selected spaces". Please note that, once you have created the blocking, the dates cannot be changed.
