# Indico Room Booking

This chapter describes Indico's **Room Booking Module**.

Indico users can **book a room** for their conference, meeting or lecture. Bookings can also be **standalone**, they do not have to be bound to any event.
Room managers can **monitor** and **moderate** all bookings. Indico administrators can **create rooms** and **manage** their data.

This section is a **tutorial** and will go through the features of the room booking module. It will show you how to:

  * 🔍 **search** for available rooms and **book** or **pre-book** them (as a regular user)
  * ✅ **accept** or ❌**reject** pre-bookings (as a room moderator)
  * 🔒 **block** a series of rooms for a given period (as a room owner)
