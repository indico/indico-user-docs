# Glossary

_Room_: meeting or conference room. Please note that the software is not suitable for managing other rooms, like offices, corridors, etc.

_Location_: physical location of rooms. Room custom attributes and possible equipment are defined on a location basis. Example: rooms at CERN may have different attributes and different equipment than rooms in Fermilab.

_Booking_: final reservation of a room. While considered final, it still may be rejected in case of emergency.

_PRE-booking_: unconfirmed reservation of a room. PRE-booking is subject to acceptance or rejection by the room's owner.

_Room responsible/manager_: the person who accepts/rejects bookings. Each room has exactly one person responsible. A person may be responsible for any number of rooms.

_Room blocking_: a restriction created by a room manager which prevents users from booking the rooms listed in the blocking unless they have explicit permission to override the permission or own the rooms.
