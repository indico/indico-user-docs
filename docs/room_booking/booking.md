# Book a Room

As a first step click on the button *Book a Room* in the horizontal menu. In the booking area you have to specify the kind of booking, date range and time range in which you want to search for bookings. You can also search by building number or room name if you want  to find a specific room in a specific location.

If you want to book the room for only one day, simply click on *Single booking* and on the date you want by choosing the correct month and day. You will also have to choose the time interval you want to book it for.

If instead you want to book a room for several consecutive days, weeks, or months, click on *Daily* or *Recurring booking*
