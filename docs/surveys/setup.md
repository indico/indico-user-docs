# Setting up a Survey

First you will have to login in to Indico and create an **event** that matches your needs (meeting or lecture or conference). To learn how to do this, please see the relevant sections in this documentation.

On your event management page, accessible by clicking on the **pencil** on the top of the event display page, select _Surveys_, which is under _Organization_ on the left banner.

Click on _Create Survey_ to start the Survey definition.

Choose a _Title_ for your survey and fill the introduction box with some text you want to be shown as a description.

Decide whether you allow _Anonymous submissions_ or not,
if you want to put a _limit_ on the number of _submissions_ accepted,
if you want to make the survey _public_ or reserved for a selected few,
and whether you allow a _partial completion_ of the survey,

Decide whether you want to enable email _Notifications_ related to the survey.
If you select _YES_, then type in the email addresses of the users who will receive these notifications in the appropriate boxes, the first box for when the survey **starts**, and the second one for each time the survey is **filled** by a participant.Write one email address per line, no separators are accepted.

When you are finished, click on _Save_.

## Create the questionnaire

To do this, click on _Manage_, and then on _Prepare questionnaire_.

You can either import an existing questionnaire, or define a new one.

You may  divide your questionnaire in sections. _Sections_ contain
_questions_ and questions will show up within the corresponding section, except for those in the "_Standalone section_", which will show up at the top level.

For each question, you can choose a different modality, such as multiple choice, a "yes" or "no" answer, and so on.

While creating a new section, by clicking on _Add section_, decide whether you want a standard section, or a standalone one.

Type in the _Title_ of your section and a Description explaining what you are asking the users to do.

Click on _Save_ and the section will be displayed.

Time to add some items to your section.

You can click on _Add text item_ if your want to include an item that only contains your informative text.
Otherwise you can add one of the actual questions that the survey participant will have to answer.

In the _Add text item_ pop-up write your prompting text in the box. Click on _Save_ in order to show the text item in your section.

Click on the tab _Add question_ and select the question modality that suits your needs, e.g. _Single choice_ question, as per this figure:

This means that the user will be able to select only **one** from the available options.

Type the question in the _Title_ box, for example "Will you use Indico to make your own survey?" and add a _Description_ if you need to, for example: "Select one of the candidate answers below", then indicate whether you want the answer to this question to be _Required_ in order for the survey to be effectively submitted.

Select whether you want your options to be displayed as _Radio buttons_ or a _Drop-down list_.
If you choose radio buttons, indicate whether you want them displayed _Vertically_ or _Horizontally_.

Type in the Options that you want your participant to choose and click on _Save_ once you are finished. The figure below shows the above options selected:

Now that you have created your _Section_, you can change the order of presentation of your question and item. To do this, you can drag your question or item by using the grey rectangle that will appear on the left.

You can do the same with your entire section, by dragging it using the grey rectangle at the top.
