Then, type in the _Title_ for your lecture and choose the _Date_ of your event. By clicking on _Add occurrence_ you can add more dates of the same lecture series. Do the same for the hour of the day and the duration of your event.

Adjust, if needed, the timezone to reflect the region your lecture takes place.
You may choose the _Location_ of your event. If you are offered a  meeting rooms’ list to choose from, please **remember** that room reservation has to be done separately.


After having chosen the location of your lecture, you will have to select your _Speakers_.
These may be existing users, so you find them by typing their name. Click on _Search_, and if the user exists, you can select his/her name and add it.
Otherwise, you can manually insert users you want to include, by typing in their name and email address. **The email is mandatory**.

By default, all speakers are marked as _Submitters_, which
means that they can upload their presentation to Indico themselves.

Then, you will have to select your _Protection mode_. By default, the protection mode is set to _Inheriting_, that means that you will inherit the rights from the category your Lecture belongs to. In this example figure it is _Public_, so that everyone can see it, but if you choose another category and you want your event to be public regardless of its category restrictions, you can make the change by clicking on _Public_. Otherwise, you can select _Protected_ if you want the lecture to be visible to a selected few only, e.g. the category managers and the users you will give access to.

Once you’re finished, click on _Create Event_.
In this page, you will be able to see the details of your lecture, and you can change them by clicking on the pencil on your right.
For example, to add a description. After every change, click on _Save_ to confirm.

Click on _Switch to display view_ and check if all the details of your lecture are correct.
