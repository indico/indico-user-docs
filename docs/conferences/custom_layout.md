### Layout customisation

While in event management  mode click on _Layout_, under the tab _Customisation_.

The _General_ section offers several options, e.g. the possibility to _Enable search_ on your pages

The _Header style_ section offers a box for you to select the colours for your text, and for the background of your Indico pages.

The _Announcement_ section enables you to write an announcement text to be displayed below the _Title_.

Under the _Timetable_ section, you can change your Indico theme style, e.g. to group your Timetable entries by room or to always show a detailed view of the Timetable by default.

In the _Theme_ section, you can select one of the available default colours as your Theme for your Indico pages.
Alternatively, you may upload a css file with your code, so you will be able to completely customise your pages.

Finally, you can upload a **logo** for your event.
