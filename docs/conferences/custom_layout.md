The _Announcement_ section enables you to write an announcement text to be displayed below the _Title_.

Under the _Timetable_ section, you can change your Indico theme style, e.g. to group your Timetable entries by room or to always show a detailed view of the Timetable by default.

In the _Theme_ section, you can select one of the available default colours as your Theme for your Indico pages.
Alternatively, you may upload a css file with your code, so you will be able to completely customise your pages.

Finally, you can upload a **logo** for your event.
