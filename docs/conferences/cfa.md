See here these steps in detail:

As an event **manager** click on _Call for Abstracts_ on the left banner, under _Organization_.

Click on _Enable module_ and you will be directed to your "Call for Abstracts" page.

On this page, you will be able to:
- define _Settings_ related to the types of questions asked during the review of an abstract,
- select the users who will review the abstracts,
- officially open the call for abstracts

and more...

The _Schedule_ box defines when the call for abstracts will be open for submissions, at a given future date, or right now.

Before opening the Call for Abstracts, you have to define the parameters below.

### Email notifications

To customise the email notification templates to send to the users who submit their abstracts, click on _Notifications_, and click on _Add new one_. Here you can add what we call a "notification ruleset", i.e. a specific email template to send when a rule is matched. For example: if an abstract is submitted, a certain email notification will be sent.

Choose a _Title_ for your ruleset, and select the email template that you want, for example “Submit”. Then you will have to select a rule, for example “submit”, like your email template. click on _Add new rule_ and select _Submitted_. Click on _Save_.

You can add new rulesets by clicking on _Add new one_, for example for when a abstract is _Accepted_ or _Rejected_.

### Configure abstract submission

From the "Call for Abstracts" management page, click on _Settings_ on the _Submissions_ raw which leads to to the _Configure abstract submission_ screen.

Write in an _Announcement_ you want to be displayed when users submit their abstracts.

Select the options that suit you, such as:
- allowing the selection of multiple tracks,
- making the track selection mandatory

etc.

If you want to limit the abstract submission to a selected few, you can add a limited number of users in _Authorized submitters_.

Scroll down for the instructions box, if you wish to insert some additional advice to submitters. Click on _Save_.

The _Fields and types_ raw contains options, where you (as conference manager) will have to define and add the type of the contributions you allow, such as _Oral_ or _Poster_, for example.
Click on _Contribution types_, _New contribution type_ and create a few.

From the same  _Fields and types_ raw click on the _Abstract fields_ box, to add new fields tailored to your event, such as a question, or simple text. To do this, click on _Add new field_, and then on _Single choice_ if you allow only one of the available options. Enter the question and select how your want your question to be displayed, for example with radio buttons, displayed vertically. Click on _Save_ and close the window.

### Configure Abstract Reviewing options

Always on the "Call for Abstracts" management page a raw on _Reviewing_ options allows you to define the questions used in the abstract reviewing process.

![](../assets/conference_review_def.png)

Click on _Roles_. In this page, you can add users as _Reviewers_ and _Conveners_. Reviewers provide an assessment of the abstract with their review, and they can consult only their own reviews.
Conveners can read all reviews in their tracks and, like the event managers, can act as _Judges_, who can effectively accept or reject an abstract based on the feedback left by the Reviewers.

![](../assets/conference_reviewers.png)

The idea is that you can have a team of specialists for specific tracks, such as “Online Computing”, in the example above.
You may _Add_ Reviewers or Conveners for a selected track (or for “all tracks” at the top). You will be offered the possibility to _Search_ for existing users and add them.

Click on _Save_ once you’ve chosen all the relevant people for these roles.

Now click on _Settings_, at the right of _Roles_ to define, as event manager, a set of questions, to  be used as a guide for the reviewers and the scale for the answers to these questions, from 0 to 5 for example.

Below you have certain options such as allowing conveners to accept or reject an abstract, allowing comments in your review page, and allow contributors in the comments.

Under _Review questions_, type in your questions, click at the disk icon on your right to save your question and click on _Add_ if you want to add a new question, for example “what is the quality of the content?"

![](../assets/conference_review_instructions.png)

Finally, write in some instructions for the Reviewers and for the Judges, who need to ultimately accept or reject an abstract based on the review.

Once you have chosen your _Scale_ and your _questions_, click on _Save_ at the bottom of the page.

### The Book of Abstracts

The book of abstracts is a configurable and downloadable document (in pdf) where only the accepted abstracts will be published.

To configure the book of abstracts, click on _Settings_ from the relevant raw of the "Call for Abstracts" management page.

Write any additional text that will be included on the document, and select the sorting criteria for the abstracts’ appearance in the book.  Click on _Save_.

### The List of Abstracts

This is the list of **all** abstracts and it is built automatically once the "Call for Abstracts" is open.
You can rearrange this list by clicking on _Manage_.

### Open the Call for Abstracts

From the same management page, you can click on _Schedule_ and select the start, the end and modification deadline of your call for abstracts. Otherwise, if you want to open it right away, simply click on _Start now_.
