These steps in detail:
Enter the event **management** interface by clicking at the pencil at the top of the display view page.
Click on _Programme_, on your left under _Organisation_.

The Program of your conference is divided in different tracks.
Tracks cover the subjects presented at the conference.
For example, a first track called “Online computing”, a second track called “Offline computing”, and so on.

Click on _Add track_, and select the title of your track, as well as a brief description.

Click on _Save_ to add your first track and repeat the process for all your tracks.

You can drag and drop your tracks and change their order using the grey rectangle at the top of each track.

Tracks **must** be defined before opening the _Call for Abstracts_, so that submitters can choose the track their abstracts belong to.
